# InterviewBit

This repo contains my solutions to some of the questions on the website https://www.interviewbit.com. Please note that they do not contain main function and hence can't be directly run on any other IDE except on InterviewBit.

Note:

1. Some of these solutions contain multiple approaches. I have commented out the other approaches and uncommented the most optimal one
2. Some of these solutions might be different from the Solution Approach suggested by InterviewBit but either way they were all accepted in the InterviewBit platform as a correct and optimal solution.

Please take a look at the solutions only after giving an honest try to the InterviewBit questions. I hope these solutions are able to help you :)
